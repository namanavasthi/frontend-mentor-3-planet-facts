## Thoughts

- specs are better than the `junior` and `newbee` versions
- a lot of information is missing, wrt image size variations based on size of planet ðŸ˜ 
- colors are all over the place
- design system doesn't specify responsive text size
- lot of custom typography ðŸ˜ 
- wasn't able to use @tailwind/typography cause of the number of custom styles
- weird colors in nav bar ðŸ˜ 
- I guess it's a developer expectation that design system focuses more on mobile than desktop
- NOT BEING ABLE TO INSPECT ELEMENTS AND SEE THE RELATIVE POSITIONING IS MY BIGGEST COMPLAIN! really sucks to not be able to see how much an element is padded wrt. another ðŸ˜ 
- prefer zeplin specs over raw sketch/figma files
- incomplete mobile renditions doesn't help either ðŸ˜ 
- couldn't work for long on desktop comps, had some family biz to take care of. isn't as good as i'd want it to be
